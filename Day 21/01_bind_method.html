          /*
            Problem;
            This below code is not works as expected, because when
            button is clicked the "handleClick" is called, and
            keyword 'this' inside the "handleClick" also have the
            reference/context of button, but still no access of
            object's other properties i.e., library, server
          */

          //   document
          //     .querySelector("button")
          //     .addEventListener("click", this.handleClick);

          /*
            Solution;
            So, we use bind method that attach the references/contexts
            of both the button as well as the object
          */

          document
            .querySelector("button")
            .addEventListener("click", this.handleClick.bind(this));
        }

        handleClick() {
          console.log("Button is clicked");
          console.log(this);
          console.log(this.server);
        }
      }

      const app = new React();
