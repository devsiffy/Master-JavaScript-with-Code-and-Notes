=> Variables in JavaScript
Variables are like containers that hold information such as names, numbers, or other values. In JavaScript, we can create variables in different ways.

-> let is the modern and recommended way to create a variable. It lets you change the value later if you want.
-> const is used to create a variable that cannot change. It holds a constant value.
-> var is the old way to create variables. It is not recommended because it can cause problems in bigger programs.
-> You can also create a variable without using any keyword, but this is a bad practice and should be avoided.

=> How to Show Output
To see what is inside a variable or to check a value, we use commands like:

-> console.log() which prints the value as simple text.
-> console.table() which shows the values in a table format, useful when you have many values.

=> Data Types in JavaScript
JavaScript has different types of data. These tell the computer what kind of value is stored.

-> Primitive data types are simple. These include:

String: words or text inside quotes
Number: any number like 5 or 100
Boolean: true or false
Null: means empty or no value
Undefined: means the value is not set
Symbol: special unique values
BigInt: very large numbers that normal numbers cannot hold

-> Non-primitive data types are more complex. These include arrays (list of values), objects (key and value pairs), and dates.

=> How to Check Data Types
To find out what type a variable is, we use the keyword typeof. It tells us if the value is a string, number, boolean, or something else.
You can write it in two ways: typeof value or typeof(value).

=> Converting Data Types
Sometimes, we need to change the type of a value. This is called type conversion.

-> Converting to Number: We use Number(value) to change a value into a number. If the value is text with letters, the result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". Even though it says not a number, its type is still number.

-> Converting to Boolean: We use Boolean(value) to change a value into true or false. Values like 0, empty string, null, and undefined become false. Other values become true.

-> Converting to String: We use String(value) to change any value into text.
