====================
Object Destructuring
====================

Destructuring helps you get values from an object easily and store them in variables.

In your code:
    * You created an object named user with some properties.
    * You used destructuring to get:
        → username directly from the object.
        → email, but renamed it to email_addr.

What this teaches:
    * How to get one property from an object.
    * How to rename a property while destructuring.

Tip:
    * Destructuring is often used with API responses or user data.


=============
Intro to JSON
=============

JSON means JavaScript Object Notation.

It is a format used to store and share data.

Looks like a JavaScript object, but it is written as a string.

Used a lot when working with APIs and external data.

Basic idea:
    * Keys and values
    * Keys must be in double quotes
    * Cannot use functions or comments inside JSON

Example use:
    * Send user data from frontend to backend
    * Receive data from server

You did not write JSON code, but it is closely related to objects.


=======================
Functions in JavaScript
=======================

Your code shows 4 types of functions.

1. Normal Function
------------------

    * greet() just shows a message using console.log.
    * Does not take any input or return anything.
Use:
    * Good for actions like showing messages.


2. Function with Return
-----------------------

    * add(num1, num2) returns the sum of two numbers.
    * The result is saved in a variable.
Use:
    * Return is used when we need to get a value from a function.
    * Very useful in calculations and logic.


3. Function with If Condition
-----------------------------

    * userLoginMsg(username) checks if username exists.
    * If not, it shows a message.
    * If yes, it returns a welcome message.
Use:
    * Use `if` to control what the function does.
    * Return can stop the function early (exit point).


4. Function with Default Values
-------------------------------

    * sayName(name = "M Umair") uses a default name if no name is given.
Use:
    * Default values prevent errors.
    * Makes function safer to use.
