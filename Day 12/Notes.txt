========================
JavaScript Loops and Map
========================


While Loop
----------

The while loop runs a block of code again and again "while the condition is true".

→ It checks the condition "before" running the code.
→ If the condition is false from the beginning, the loop will "not run".
→ You can use it when you are not sure how many times the loop should run.


Do-While Loop
-------------

The do-while loop runs the code block "first", and then checks the condition.

→ It will "always run at least one time", even if the condition is false.
→ Good for cases where one-time execution is needed before checking the condition.


For...of Loop
-------------

The for...of loop is used to go through "values" in:

    * Arrays
    * Strings
    * Maps

→ It gives the "value" of each item, not the key or index.
→ It does "not work on objects". Trying to use it on an object will give an error.
→ Best for clean and simple loops when you only care about the values.


For...in Loop
-------------

The for...in loop is used to go through "keys or indexes" in:

    * Objects (keys)
    * Arrays (indexes)

→ It gives the "key" (for object) or "index" (for array).
→ You can use the key/index to get the value.
→ It "does not work correctly on maps" — even though it doesn’t give an error, the output is not useful.
→ Best when looping through object properties.


forEach Loop
------------

forEach is a "method of array". It is used to run a function for every item in the array.

→ It is a "higher-order function", and it takes a "callback".

→ Works well for:
    * Arrays
    * Arrays of objects

→ It gives:
    * Value
    * Index (optional)
    * The full array (optional)

→ You "cannot use break or continue" in forEach. The loop will always go through all items.
→ Mostly used for cleaner code and easy data handling.


==================
Map Data Structure
==================

A Map is a "collection of key-value pairs".

→ Keys in a Map can be any type — string, number, object, etc.
→ Map "keeps the order" of entries as you add them.

→ It is different from an object:
    * Object keys must be strings or symbols.
    * Object does not guarantee key order.

→ Maps are useful when you need:
    * Custom key types
    * Order of entries
    * Clean looping using for...of

→ for...of works great with Map to get [key, value] pairs.
→ for...in should "not be used" with Map.
