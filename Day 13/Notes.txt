=============
Array Methods
=============


filter() Method
---------------

filter() is used to pick some values from an array based on a condition.
It runs a function for each value in the array.  
If the condition is true, the value is added to the new array.
The original array does not change.
You get a new array with only the values that match the condition.

Use case:
    → Get values greater than a number  
    → Filter even or odd numbers  
    → Pick items that match a keyword


map() Method
------------

map() is used to change each value in the array.
It runs a function on every value and makes a new array.
The original array stays the same.
You get a new array with updated values.

Use case:
    → Multiply each number  
    → Add something to each item  
    → Change string format (like uppercase)


reduce() Method
---------------

reduce() is used to take all values in the array and make one result.

It needs two things:
    → a function with accumulator and current value  
    → an initial value (starting point)

The function runs on each item and adds the result to the accumulator.
At the end, you get one single value.

Use case:
    → Add all numbers  
    → Multiply all values  
    → Count total items or totals from objects


Method Chaining
---------------

You can use multiple array methods one after another.
This is called "method chaining".
It makes your code short and clean, but only if used correctly.

In chaining:
    → map can be used to change values  
    → filter can remove unwanted values  
    → You can use as many methods as needed

Example idea:
    → First: change values  
    → Then: filter the result  
    → Then: reduce if needed

Always check step-by-step what each method is doing.

DOM Basics and Tree
===================


What is DOM?
------------

DOM means "Document Object Model".
When you open a webpage, the browser changes the HTML into a tree structure.
Each HTML tag becomes a "node" (a part of the tree).
The whole page is a "DOM tree".  
You can see this tree using browser dev tools or refer to the file "dom_tree.png" in your folder.

Why DOM is important:
    → It lets JavaScript talk to HTML  
    → You can change HTML using JavaScript  
    → You can get, add, or remove elements


window and document objects
---------------------------

"window" is the main object created by the browser.
Everything in JavaScript (on the browser) is part of the window.
"document" is a part of window. It connects JavaScript to the HTML page.

Use window and document like this:
    → window → controls browser-level things  
    → document → controls webpage content

To explore them:
    → Use console.log(window)  
    → Use console.log(document)  
    → Use console.dir(document) to see full structure

Why it matters:
    → You need document to select or change HTML elements  
    → You need window to work with alerts, timers, etc.
