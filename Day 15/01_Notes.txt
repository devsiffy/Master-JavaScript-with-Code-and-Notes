DOM Edit and Delete Elements
============================


Why Edit and Delete?
--------------------

In real websites, we often need to change or remove things on the page.

For example:
    * Edit a list item when user clicks "Edit"
    * Delete an item when user clicks "Delete"
    * Update content without reloading the page

These actions make websites more interactive and user-friendly.


How to Edit Elements
--------------------

To "edit" an element in the DOM, we usually:

    * Create a new element
    * Add the new content to it
    * Use the replaceWith() method to replace the old element

Example steps:
    * Find the old element you want to change
    * Create a new element (like a new <li>)
    * Add new text to the new element
    * Replace the old one using replaceWith()

This keeps the list fresh and updated with the new data.


How to Delete Elements
----------------------

To "delete" an element in the DOM:

    * Find the element
    * Use the remove() method

This will remove the element from the page completely.

You can delete:
    * The first item in a list
    * The last item
    * Any specific item using querySelector or other methods
