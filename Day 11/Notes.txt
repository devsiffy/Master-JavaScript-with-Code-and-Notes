==========================
Control Flow in JavaScript
==========================

Control flow means the order in which code runs in a program.

In JavaScript, we can control how our code works by using different statements like:
    * if-else
    * switch
    * ternary operator
    * loops (like for loop)
    * break and continue


if-else Statement
-----------------

if-else is used when we want to run different code based on a condition.

If the condition is true → it runs the "if" block.

If the condition is false → it runs the "else" block.

    * You can also write only the "if" block.
    * You can use multiple conditions with "else if".
    * You can also use "!" to reverse the condition.

    → Example:
        * if (isLoggedIn) → runs if user is logged in
        * if (!isLoggedIn) → runs if user is not logged in

**Double NOT (!!)** is a trick to convert any value into true or false.

    * !!"hello" → true
    * !!0 → false
    * !!undefined → false

**Logical Operators:**
    * AND (&&): both conditions must be true
    * OR (||): at least one condition is true
    * NOT (!) → reverses the value


switch Statement
----------------

switch is used when we want to compare one value with many cases.

It is good when there are many "if-else" conditions for the same variable.

Each case is checked one by one. If a case matches, that code runs.

Use "break" to stop checking after one case is true.

    → If no case matches, use "default" to run some code.


Truthy and Falsy Values
-----------------------

JavaScript has special values that are treated as "false".

**Falsy Values:**
    * false
    * 0
    * -0
    * 0n (BigInt zero)
    * ""
    * null
    * undefined
    * NaN

All other values are **truthy**.

**Some tricky truthy values:**
    * "0" (string)
    * "false" (string)
    * " " (space)
    * []
    * {}
    * function() {}

Always remember these for condition checking.


Ternary Operator
----------------

Ternary is a short form of if-else.

    Syntax:
        condition ? do_if_true : do_if_false;

It is good for small checks.

    → Example:
        price < 50 ? say yes : say no;


Nullish Coalescing Operator ( ?? )
----------------------------------

This operator is used when we want to give a default value only if the original value is **null** or **undefined**.

It will **not** work if value is 0 or empty string. Only null or undefined.

    → Example:
        val = null ?? 10 → result is 10
        val = undefined ?? 5 → result is 5
        val = 0 ?? 5 → result is 0 (because 0 is not null/undefined)


======================
For Loop in JavaScript
======================

for loop is used to repeat some code again and again.

    Syntax:
        for (start; condition; step) {
            run this code
        }

It is used when we know how many times we want to run the loop.

**Nested Loop** → a loop inside another loop.
    * Used for tables, patterns, etc.

**Loop on an Array**
    * We can loop through items in an array using for loop.


for loop with break and continue
--------------------------------

**break** → stop the loop when a certain condition is true.

    * Used to exit the loop early.

**continue** → skip one loop turn, but keep looping.

    * Used to skip certain values.

    → Example:
        If i == 5 → break → stops loop
        If i == 5 → continue → skips 5, moves to next
